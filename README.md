# Introduction:

Large cities such as New York, Montreal, and Toronto are working to increase greenspace and canopy cover in order to improve the quality of life of their residents. Public trees provide various benefits such as improving air quality, mitigating urban heat islands, as well as providing biodiversity and ecosystem sevices in urban areas. However, these benefits are not equally distributed among all communities, with low-income and marginalized neighborhoods often having fewer trees and experiencing the most significant environmental burdens.

Studies have shown that the distribution of public trees is often influenced by socio-economic factors such as income, race, and ethnicity. A quantitative review by Ziter (2016) found that the distribution of urban green spaces and trees is highly uneven and that low-income neighborhoods have less green infrastructure. This trend is evident in Canadian cities, such as montreal, where Ziter highlights how trees are distributed unequally in Montreal, with low-income neighborhoods having fewer trees, which could coincide with the lack of services available to implement and maintain green infrastructure. 

Furthermore, a study by Foster et al. (2022) examines the distribution of urban tree canopy in different neighborhoods in five US cities and found that disadvantaged communities had significantly less tree cover compared to their wealthier communities. Similarly, a study by Yi et al. (2020) examines environmental inequality in four major cities in Eastern Canada and found that socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods had less tree cover and lower levels of socio-ecological resilience.

When it comes to quality of life, there should be no injustice. Although there isn't a framework to determine the optimal quality of life, there should be a framework available that highlights various factors such as an acceptable canopy cover to reduce urban heat islands, a minimum amount of greenspaces that provide ecosystem services to the human and non-human population, and a method of monitoring how effective the various mitigation practices are. 

For this project, I will be examining 3 types of data, which is similar to Foster et al. (2022), and Landry, F. et al.(2020). 
1. Income
2. Population Density
3. Montreal Public Tree Database

These studies also used other programs in order to examine canopy cover, NDVI, or land-cover classification, which do not pertain to this course. 

Looking at this data, I hypothesize that these three variables will have a very strong coorelation between eachother such that higher density and more dwelling in low income status will have less public trees in their database.

# Issues I ran into

I have had this MacBook since 2015, so it is getting quite old, and i really wanted to do some plots and maps so i can visually examine the maps, because i love doing that, but unfortunately no matter now hard i tried, it kept freezing my computer and giving me storage errors. So my intent was to do maps, but unfortunately due to my distance from school, it wasnt feasible to travel to school and work on a stronger computer, but I really had fun exploring the trees dataset and I could have just kept doing that.
